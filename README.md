# Planta Baja Web Project

This is a simple but functional website. It is used to improve the organization of planta baja.

## What is planta baja?

Planta baja is the ground floor in the student's house were we live.

We are a group of students and this web page was made to help us solve some of our organizational issues.

Here we can see:

- The state of account, debts, and payments made.
- The cleaning calendar that refers to the daily cleaning of the kitchen area.
- The weekly cleaning groups. In said cleaning we take care of cleaning all the common spaces.

## Considerations

This website was made in march of 2022. None of the personal data in this repository is real.
